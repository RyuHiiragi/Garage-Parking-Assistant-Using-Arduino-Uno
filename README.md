# Garage Parking Assistant Using Arduino Uno

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a garage parking assistant using an Arduino Uno and an ultrasonic sensor. The system measures the distance between the car and the garage wall, providing visual feedback via LEDs and audible alerts via a buzzer to assist with safe parking <button class="citation-flag" data-index="1">. This project is ideal for improving parking accuracy and preventing accidental collisions in tight spaces.

## Overview
The garage parking assistant uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the car and the garage wall. Based on the measured distance, the system provides feedback via LEDs and a buzzer <button class="citation-flag" data-index="6">. A green LED indicates a safe distance, a yellow LED warns the driver to slow down, and a red LED with a buzzer alerts the driver when the car is too close <button class="citation-flag" data-index="8">. This project helps drivers park safely and accurately.
